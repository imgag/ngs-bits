=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
* Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
* Copy help text of fields to schema and use them as tooltip for view tabs
*** Allow adding/editing data in NGSD
    - use for: processing system, sample, processed sample
    - remove old unneeded edit functionality
    - Copy help text of NGSD to schema and use them as tooltip for view tabs and DBEditor
        - project email notification: semicolon, informed when run finished
** Add run overview dialog/tab
* Add admin section (genome, device, MID, procesing system, sample group, sender, speicies)
    - with text search
* Add users section
* Add statistics section
* Add batch import of samples/processed samples and integrate GSmix checks (remove GSmix)
- Sample tab: allow import disease info, disease group/status, gender from same samples
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample (requested by CS)

GSvar:
** gene selector: add support for CnvHunter (also for low-QC regions > update ClinCNV)
** add visualization of NGSD CNVs (table + IGV-like view):
    - number of overlapping CNVs (by type gain/loss)
    - overlapping class 4/5 CNVs
    - disease group
* Allow ClinCNV upload
    - small variants and CNVs
    - only flag variants and perform manual upload at the end of each quater
- add coloring of quality columns in DB tables (e.g. in run tab)
## merge multi-sample comp-het and hom filters + create relaxed filters like in single sample case
- replace GeneInfoOMIM webservice by new tab in GSvar (after removing Patientennetz)
* SV widget
    - add size filter - have a look at the overlap between manta and freebayes
    - add overlapping genes and allow filtering for comp-hets (be carefull with small indels)
    - add OMIM annotations
    - add gene annotation and type (coding/splicing/intronic/intergenic)

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
