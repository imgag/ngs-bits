=== TODO ===

libs:
- integration of htslib: use pileup, use VCF support, use tabix support
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
** Add sender widget (link from sample info)
** Add processing system widget (link from processed sample info)
*** Allow adding/editing data in NGSD
    - Run/processed sample/sample in general
        - Add email support for runs "run finished" and "analysis finished"
    - Set processed sample qualities in batch (selection)
    - sample: import disease info, disease group/status, gender from same samples
    - sample: import disease group/status from GenLab (sample - disease status: add 'Unclear') - select * FROM v_krankheitsgruppe_pattyp...
** Add run overview dialog/tab
**** add CNVs to NGSD and allow classification
    - CNV call-set: quality metrics + tool/version + quality (n/a, good, medium, bad)
    - CNV calls: quality metrics + classification/comment
    - add import script for CNVs
        - import all data from exomes ssHAEv6+7/TruSeq PCR-free genomes
- NGSD annotation: export VCF, use VCF for annotation (also works on external servers)

GSvar:
## Filter: enhancer/promotor - de-novo
## merge multi-sample comp-het and hom filters + create relaxed filters like in single sample case
- Implement OMIM search via API - example: DX184728_01, Okulopharyngeal muskulÃ¤re Dystrophie, PABPN1 (wait for API access)
* Add special report for trios/multi-sample with genotype overview > change format to RTF first (AG)
* Add highlighting of imprinting genes to CNVs, ROHs and UPDs
* GenLab XML report: male => change 'hom' variants outside PAR region on chrX/chrY to 'hemi' (when GenLab import is updated)
*** Report variant selection
    - allow marking variants for report inclusion (report_pathogenic, report_possibly_pathogenic, report_incidental_finding (ACMG), report_scientific, no_report_artefact, no_report_no_disease_association)
    - store marked variants in NGSD when writing the report (who, when, comment, applied default filter)
    - load marked variants from NGSD after loading the case again
    - add filter to show marked variants only
    - also flag which variants are exported to GenLab8 via the XML report
        -fields to fill: sample outcome, gaps report (custom), processing system, variants, export date
    - print sheet with flagged variants
- Visualize tracking of variants when from split complex variant (wait for VcfBreakComplex)

Tools:
- NGSDExportGenes: Add inheritance, gnomAD oe (3x), HPO terms, OMIM infos?
- NGSDImportHPO: Add G2P database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype)
- NGSDPrecalculate: fix missing/different disease group/status for sample with relation "same sample"
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
