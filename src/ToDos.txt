GSvar:
# add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > user has to set one affected as index > only report config of index is edited
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples
- Variant tab: add disease group significance (remove duplicates because of family, calculates significance of one disease group vs the others)
- Allow ClinVar upload as soon as the API is available
    - until then: perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - also support CNVs/SVs?

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
- implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM)
