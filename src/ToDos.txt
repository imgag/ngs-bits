=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls
- The call of "resizeColumnsToContents()" in "GUIHelper::resizeTableCells" is slow for large tables. Maybe we can re-implement it to use only the top x lines only?!
- support CRAM in addition to BAM: use htslib functions with hts_ prefix instead of bam_ prefix

GSvar:
### Add GSvar score functionality: calculation, warning if no HPOs are set, ranking/filter by rank
## Allow adding variant outside of target region to report
    - add checkboxes to variants in report dialog
    - checkboxes for variants in ROI are checked and disabled
    - checkboxes for variants ouside or ROI are unchecked and enabled
    - only variants which are checked are added to the report config
## Force the following settings before report generation:
    - disease group/status (for index and related samples)
    - HPO for index and all related affected
    - diagnostic status for index
    - causal diagnostic variant(s) for "solved cases"
    - Trio: set trio parents as unaffected with same disease group as child?!
## Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
# Layout/documentation of SomaticReportDialog > AXEL
# Filter somatic ranges > AXEL
# Binomial distribution calculator for AF/DP.
# add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > user has to set one affected as index > only report config of index is edited
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples
* Allow ClinVar upload
    - small variants and CNVs
    - only flag variants and perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - use XML format: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/clinvar/ClinVarDataDictionary.pdf (see also email 'Programm fÃ¼r AG Genom-Informatik')

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)
- RohHunter:
    - exclude CNP regions?
    - optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
    - test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
    - test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
    - test if sub-population AF improves result
    - benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES

External:
- implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM)

GSVar features to dicuss:
# Causal variants: force 'mode of inheritance' - not 'n/a', not 'AD+AR', not 'XLR+XLD' > remove from schema!
# Validation method: 'PCR' > 'Sanger sequencing'
- Add family table linking samples in one family with "father", "mother", "child", "aunte", "cousin", ... OR import samples relations from GenLab?? > FH/LUCIA/TOH
- Add liquid handler robot to processed sample talbe > FH/LAB/TOH
- Correctly import sample sender data from GenLab > TOH/STEPHAN O.
- CAVE functionality for Genes (use e.g. for imprinting), model reasons? > SWAL
- Sample: source tissue (for RNA) > TOH
- Evaluation sheet: Add comment text, e.g. bad CNV quality > FH
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample > CS
