=== TODO ===

libs:
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)
- integration of htslib: use pileup, use VCF support, use tabix support
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
*** Processed sample widget: show missing infos (also check sample/run~SAVdata)
*** Allow adding/editing data in NGSD
    - Run/processed sample/sample in general
        - Add email support for runs "run finished" and "analysis finished"
    - Set processed sample qualities in batch (selection)
** Add run overview dialog/tab
* add CNVs to NGSD and allow classification (wait for ClinCNV)

GSvar:
*** Processed sample selection for re-analysis with auto-completion
*** change sub-panel design to Ensembl instead of CCDS transcripts (example CNGA1, gencode basic?)
## merge multi-sample comp-het and hom filters + create relaxed filters like in single sample case
- Implement OMIM search via API - example: DX184728_01, Okulopharyngeal muskuläre Dystrophie, PABPN1 (wait for API access)
** Allow classification of unseen variants (how do we check that the variants are valid?)
* Add special report for trios/multi-sample with genotype overview > change format to RTF first (AG)
* Add highlighting of imprinting genes to CNVs, ROHs and UPDs
* Add gnomAD oe score / ExAC CNV / inheritance (megSAP) and filter for CNVs (GSvar) (wait for ClinCNV)
* GenLab XML report: male => change 'hom' variants outside PAR region on chrX/chrY to 'hemi' (when GenLab import is updated)
*** Report variant selection
    - allow marking variants for report inclusion (report_pathogenic, report_possibly_pathogenic, report_incidental_finding (ACMG), report_scientific, no_report_artefact, no_report_no_disease_association)
    - store marked variants in NGSD when writing the report (who, when, comment, applied default filter)
    - load marked variants from NGSD after loading the case again
    - add filter to show marked variants only
    - also flag which variants are exported to GenLab8 via the XML report
    - print sheet with flagged variants
- Visualize tracking of variants when from split complex variant (wait for VcfBreakComplex)

Tools:
- NGSDPrecalculate: fix missing/different disease group/status for sample with relation "same sample"
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: use higher base quality in overlap (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
