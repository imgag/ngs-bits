=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls
- The call of "resizeColumnsToContents()" in "GUIHelper::resizeTableCells" is slow for large tables. Maybe we can re-implement it to use only the top x lines only?!
- support CRAM in addition to BAM: use htslib functions with hts_ prefix instead of bam_ prefix

GSvar:
### Store successfull trio/multi analyses in NGSD (type, samples, sample infos) > do not search in the file system but in NGSD.
## Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
# add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > user has to set one affected as index > only report config of index is edited
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples
- Allow ClinVar upload as soon as the API is available
    - until then: perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - also support CNVs/SVs?

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)
- RohHunter:
    - exclude CNP regions?
    - optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
    - test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
    - test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
    - test if sub-population AF improves result
    - benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES

External:
- implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM)

GSVar features to dicuss:
- Add family table linking samples in one family with "father", "mother", "child", "aunte", "cousin", ... OR import samples relations from GenLab?? > FH/LUCIA/TOH
- Add liquid handler robot to processed sample talbe > FH/LAB/TOH
- Correctly import sample sender data from GenLab > TOH/STEPHAN O.
- CAVE functionality for Genes (use e.g. for imprinting), model reasons? > SWAL
- Sample: source tissue (for RNA) > TOH
- Evaluation sheet: Add comment text, e.g. bad CNV quality > FH
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample > CS
