=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
** Add variant tab (classification, validation, detected samples + genotype + phenotype)
** Add sender widget (link from sample info)
** Add processing system widget (link from processed sample info)
*** Allow adding/editing data in NGSD
    - Run/processed sample/sample in general
        - Add email support for runs "run finished" and "analysis finished"
    - Set processed sample qualities in batch (selection)
    - sample: import disease info, disease group/status, gender from same samples
    - sample: import disease group/status from GenLab (sample - disease status: add 'Unclear') - select * FROM v_krankheitsgruppe_pattyp...
** Add run overview dialog/tab
- Allow several disease_groups per sample (requested by CS)
##### add CNVs to NGSD
    - add to variant sheet in GSvar
    - add CNVs to XML for GenLab
    - block re-import of CNVs if report config is set for all variant types - allow deleting report config from GSvar
    - add annotation of CNVs from NGSD:
        - # overlapping CNVs (by type gain/loss)
        - overlapping class 4/5 CNVs
**** NGSD annotation (LS)
    - export VCF, use VCF for annotation
    - remove NGSDPrecalculate tool and tables 'detected_variant_counts' and 'detected_variant_counts_by_group'

GSvar:
## merge multi-sample comp-het and hom filters + create relaxed filters like in single sample case
** replace GeneInfoOMIM webservice by new tab in GSvar (after removing Patientennetz)
* trio filter: correct PAR region handling (Genetikum)
* report variant selection
    - add gaps report (custom via import) to XML report
        - CCDS +-5 bases!?
        - gap report as XML and additional report of gaps to sanger-validate as TXT
    - Trio report > trio XML (Anne,Mona)?
* SV widget
    - add size filter - have a look at the overlap between manta and freebayes
    - add overlapping genes and allow filtering for comp-hets (be carefull with small indels)
    - add OMIM annotations

Tools:
- NGSDImportHPO: Add G2P database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gene2phenotype) - if HPO people do not include it
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
