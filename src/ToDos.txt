=== TODO ===

lib:
- VcfFile: use bgzip for compression
- Statistics::mapping:
    - AT/GC dropout metric for WGS
    - add coverage uniformity metric for WGS

GSvar:
# AF/DP of variants to germline XML report (Gunnar)
# add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > user has to set one affected as index > only report config of index is edited
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples
* Allow showing somatic variants in small variants search (CS)
- Variant tab: add disease group significance (remove duplicates because of family, calculates significance of one disease group vs the others)
- Allow ClinVar upload as soon as the API is available
    - until then: perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - also support CNVs/SVs?

External:
- implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM)

GSVar features to dicuss:
- Add family table linking samples in one family with "aunte", "uncle", "cousins 1st degree", "cousins 2nd degree", "monozygotic twins", ... OR import samples relations from GenLab?? > FH/LUCIA/TOH
- Add liquid handler robot to processed sample talbe > FH/LAB/TOH
- CAVE functionality for Genes (use e.g. for imprinting), model reasons? > SWAL
- Sample: source tissue (for RNA) > TOH
- Evaluation sheet: Add comment text, e.g. bad CNV quality > FH
