=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
#### remove sample groups: ask lab>OK, Hannover, Neuulm>OK
* Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
*** Add open jobs list
- Sample tab: allow import disease info, disease group/status, gender from same samples
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample (requested by CS)
- add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > how? edit all or ask which to edit?
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples

GSvar:
*** gene selector: add support for CnvHunter (needs low-quality regions (also CNV to track name) > update ClinCNV first > update docu)
*** XML report: add OMIM gene / phenotype disease info
** Sample search: add option option "export all infos"
* Allow ClinCNV upload
    - small variants and CNVs
    - only flag variants and perform manual upload at the end of each quater
- add coloring of quality columns in DB tables (e.g. in run tab)
- replace GeneInfoOMIM webservice by new tab in GSvar (after removing Patientennetz)
** allow creating somatic report and XML-export for tumor-only (after tumor-normal is done)

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
