=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls
- The call of "resizeColumnsToContents()" in "GUIHelper::resizeTableCells" is slow for large tables. Maybe we can re-implement it to use only the top x lines only?!

NGSD:
* Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - select gaps to close in gap dialog > write to NGSD table (sample_id>sample, enum status: 'to close', 'in progress', 'closed', requested_by>user, comment)
    - make page where TA can select gaps (by gene/DX number)
        - also allow copying multiple gaps into clipboard (as table and for primer gap)
        - add link for PrimerDesign tool
* implement validation of CNVs/SVs like for small variants
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample (requested by CS)
- add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > how? edit all or ask which to edit?
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples

GSvar:
*** Add mean coverage of chrMT to report
*** Custom variant menu (custom_variant_menu=Custom Action|http://127.0.0.1/index.php?chr=[chr]&start=[start]&end=[end]&ref=[ref]&obs=[obs]&gene=[gene]\tCustom Action2|http://127.0.0.2/index.php?chr=[chr]&start=[start] (Genetikum).
**** Implement sample sheet in NGSD and add it to the XML report via the HTML report (Email Anne - Auwertebogen aus GsVar)
*** Allow finalizing report config (log date and user) => don't allow new report config modification, show report config entries as read-only (Genetikum).
    - update report configuration info: Add small variants, CNV, SV counts and causal counts, Add finalization date/user
*** Allow storing of filtered GSvar files to backup folder (defined in GSvar.ini) with file name "[ps]_[user]_[datum].GSvar" (Genetikum).
** Move variant search to separate sub-menu "variant search" -> "small variants, "CNVs", "SVs" (allow search via genes or search via chromosomal ranges in all dialogs)
** Show OMIM entries in ROH dialog like in CNV/SV dialog.
** Filter widgets (small variants, CNVs, SVs): Add option to hide variants with report config
* update ROH docu with ROH sum (ROHs >500k) for ssHAEv7 and WGS
* Trio report: force disease_group/disease_status and outcome (import trio parents as unaffected with same disease group as child)
* Allow ClinVar upload
    - small variants and CNVs
    - only flag variants and perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - use XML format: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/clinvar/ClinVarDataDictionary.pdf (see also email 'Programm für AG Genom-Informatik')
** allow creating somatic report and XML-export for tumor-only - after tumor-normal is done (AG)

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
#### implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- exclude CNP regions?
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
