=== TODO ===

libs:
* FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls
- The call of "resizeColumnsToContents()" in "GUIHelper::resizeTableCells" is slow for large tables. Maybe we can re-implement it to use only the top x lines only?!

GSvar:
## Implement "closing gaps by sanger"
    - show exon number in GapClosingDialog?
    - use info in gap calculation of report?!
# add multi-sample report-config
    - 1 affected > easy
    - >1 affected > user has to set one affected as index > only report config of index is edited
    - no report needed - is created from individual samples
- Allow ClinVar upload as soon as the API is available
    - until then: perform manual upload at the end of each quater
    - also support CNVs/SVs?

Tools:
- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier - add to https://github.com/HUPO-PSI/mzQC (CS)

External:
- implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM)

GSVar features to dicuss:
- Add family table linking samples in one family with "father", "mother", "child", "aunte", "cousin", ... OR import samples relations from GenLab?? > FH/LUCIA/TOH
- Add liquid handler robot to processed sample talbe > FH/LAB/TOH
- Correctly import sample sender data from GenLab > TOH/STEPHAN O.
- CAVE functionality for Genes (use e.g. for imprinting), model reasons? > SWAL
- Sample: source tissue (for RNA) > TOH
- Evaluation sheet: Add comment text, e.g. bad CNV quality > FH
- Sample: allow several disease_groups per sample > CS
