=== TODO ===

libs:
- VariantList:
    - determine file format from file header instead of file name => make more tools pipeable
    - use QSharedPointers to link VariantAnnotationHeaders with VariantAnnotationDescriptions (CS)
    - check vcf and tsv files if valid - columns and their descriptions (CS)
- NGSHelper: consider soft-clipping of secondary alignments (CS)
- integration of htslib: use pileup, use VCF support
- FilterGenotypeAffected: exclude comp-het variant pairs, that are present in one or more controls

NGSD:
** model sample relation: same sample, parent-child, tumor-normal, siblings
  - use 'same sample' when counting variant frequencies
  - set relations after somatic/trio pipeline is through
** annotate counts with same/different disease group/status separately
* add CNVs to NGSD and allow classification (wait for ClinCNV)

GSvar:
**** Support WGS CNV files (after entire CNV calling in megSAP is done with ClinCNV)
*** Implement OMIM search via API - example: DX184728_01, Okulopharyngeal muskuläre Dystrophie, PABPN1
*** Annotate Somatic to germline data => select GSvar > 2 columns (small variants, CNVS) with AF, DP etc.
** Put NGSD/GL8/LOVD passwords encrypted in INI file - use compiled-in master password to decrypt them

* Add highlighting of imprinting genes to CNVs, ROHs and UPDs
* Add multi-gene Google/PubMed search: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=CASP8+AND+(%22Breast+cancer%22+OR+%22Breast+carcinoma%22)+AND+2018 (SWAL)
* Add ExAC pLI / ExAC CNV / inheritance (megSAP) and filter for CNVs (GSvar) (wait for ClinCNV)
* GenLab XML report: male => change 'hom' variants outside PAR region on chrX/chrY to 'hemi' (when GenLab import is updated)
*** Report variant selection
    - allow marking variants for report inclusion (report_pathogenic, report_possibly_pathogenic, report_incidental_finding (ACMG), report_scientific, no_report_artefact, no_report_no_disease_association)
    - store marked variants in NGSD when writing the report (who, when, comment, applied default filter)
    - load marked variants from NGSD after loading the case again
    - add filter to show marked variants only
    - also flag which variants are exported to GenLab8 via the XML report
    - print sheet with flagged variants

Tools:
** VcfToTsv: add support for CSQ field from VEP
* SeqPurge: make multi-threaded processing scale better for WGS - add writer thread
- VariantQC: insertion/deletion ratio?
* NGSDImportHPO: check that the genes listed for a variant are really affected - e.g. RIF1 is not affected by this variant but listed: clinvar_20171203.vcf:2  152346522       194453  G       A       .       .

- UPDHunter: also support chrX?
- SomaticQC: do not use precalculated triplet counts, count every time (CS)
- SomaticQC: replace 'QC:?' by real qcML identifier (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: require sorted bam and paired-end sequencing (CS)
- BamClipOverlap: use higher base quality in overlap (CS)

External:
** implement MultiQC support for ReadQC/MappingQC/VariantQC/SomaticQC (>JM): /mnt/SRV018/users/ahmattj1/dev/MultiQC/venv3/bin/multiqc -m readqc -m mappingqc -m variantqc .

RohHunter:
- optimize quality cutoffs based on variants that are het on chrX for males (AF, DP, MQM, blacklist, InDels, no AF annotation, homopolymer region,...)
- test splitting regions when dist is too high, e.g. > 100Kb => Q-score cutoff removes random parts?!
- test input of high-cov ROI to augment the input data with WT SNPs with AF>1-5%
- test if sub-population AF improves result
- benchmarks: chrX of males, add errors up to 2 percent, overlap WGS/WES
