# cppREST
A library written in C++, intended to be used for implementing HTTP API servers. Since the project heavily relies on QT, the library also uses it (to work with sockets). cppREST allows to create servers that use HTTP and HTTPS protocols (HTTP should not be used in the production environment). For each new request a new thread is created.
