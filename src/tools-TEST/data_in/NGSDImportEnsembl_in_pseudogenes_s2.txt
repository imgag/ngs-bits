# This is a pseudogene decorated resource (psiDR) file, version 0
# Each row in the file represents a pseudogene, which inlucdes following data fields:
# 
# Pseudogene_id:	ENSEMBL ID of pseudogenes
# Biotype:		biotype of the pseudogene, could be "processed_pseudogene", "nonprocessed_pseudogene", etc.
# Chromsome:		chromosome where the pseudogene resides
# Strand:		strand on which the pseudogene located
# Start:		start position of the pseudogene sequence, 1-based
# End:			end position of the pseudogene sequence, includesive
# Parent_gene:		ENSEBML gene id of the pseudogene parent, if available. OTherwise, represented by a "."
# Parent_gene:		ENSEBML transcript id of the pseudogene parent, if available. OTherwise, represented by a "."
# Parent_name:		name of the pseudogene parent
# Transcribed:		Whether the pseudogene is transcribed. 1: transcribed; 0: otherwise
# Chromatin activity:	chromation state information from Segway. 1: active state;	0: otherwise
# DnaseI_HS			DnaseI hypersensitity		1:	Has Dnase Hypersensitivity in upstream; 0: otherwise
# Active Promoter:	active TFBS at the upstrea of the pseudgene	1: Active bing sites; 0: otherwise
# Active_pol2:		active Pol2 bining sites 1: Active bing sites; 0: otherwise
# Constraint:		evolutionary constraints on each pseudogene 1: conserved; 0: otherwise.
#
# Cell ines: GM12878, K562, Helas3, Hepg2, H1hesc
