[Term]
id: HP:0000001
name: All
comment: Root of all terms in the Human Phenotype Ontology.
xref: UMLS:C0444868


[Term]
id: HP:0000005
name: Mode of inheritance
def: "The pattern in which a particular genetic trait or disorder is passed from one generation to the next." [HPO:probinson]
is_a: HP:0000001 ! All

[Term]
id: HP:0000006
name: Autosomal dominant inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a gene encoded on one of the autosomes (i.e., the human chromosomes 1-22) in which a trait manifests in heterozygotes. In the context of medical genetics, an autosomal dominant disorder is caused when a single copy of the mutant allele is present. Males and females are affected equally, and can both transmit the disorder with a risk of 50% for each child of inheriting the mutant allele." [HPO:curators]
is_a: HP:0000005 ! Mode of inheritance

[Term]
id: HP:0000007
name: Autosomal recessive inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a gene encoded on one of the autosomes (i.e., the human chromosomes 1-22) in which a trait manifests in homozygotes. In the context of medical genetics, autosomal recessive disorders manifest in homozygotes (with two copies of the mutant allele) or compound heterozygotes (whereby each copy of a gene has a distinct mutant allele)." [HPO:curators]
is_a: HP:0000005 ! Mode of inheritance


[Term]
id: HP:0001417
name: X-linked inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a gene encoded on the X chromosome." [HPO:curators]
is_a: HP:0010985 ! Gonosomal inheritance

[Term]
id: HP:0001419
name: X-linked recessive inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for recessive traits related to a gene encoded on the X chromosome. In the context of medical genetics, X-linked recessive disorders manifest in males (who have one copy of the X chromosome and are thus hemizygotes), but generally not in female heterozygotes who have one mutant and one normal allele." [HPO:curators]
is_a: HP:0001417 ! X-linked inheritance


[Term]
id: HP:0001423
name: X-linked dominant inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for dominant traits related to a gene encoded on the X chromosome. In the context of medical genetics, X-linked dominant disorders tend to manifest very severely in affected males. The severity of manifestation in females may depend on the degree of skewed X inactivation." [HPO:curators]
is_a: HP:0001417 ! X-linked inheritance

[Term]
id: HP:0001427
name: Mitochondrial inheritance
def: "A mode of inheritance that is observed for traits related to a gene encoded on the mitochondrial genome. Because the mitochondrial genome is essentially always maternally inherited, a mitochondrial condition can only be transmitted by females, although the condition can affect both sexes. The proportion of mutant mitochondria can vary (heteroplasmy)." [HPO:probinson]
is_a: HP:0000005 ! Mode of inheritance

[Term]
id: HP:0001626
name: Abnormality of the cardiovascular system
