# Running a development server

### Setting up a GSvar server for testing (on Ubuntu)

First you need a unused port on the development server. You can either select a random 5-digit port and check with `netstat -lntu` if the port is already used.
Or you can use the following 1-liner to get a free port from the kernel:

> python -c 'import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.bind(("", 0)); print(s.getsockname()[1]); s.close()' 

Additionally you have to provide a certificate. If you do not have a valid certificate for your machine you can create a self-signed one:

> openssl genrsa -out GSvarServer.key 2048
> openssl req -new -key GSvarServer.key -out GSvarServer.csr
> openssl x509 -signkey GSvarServer.key -in GSvarServer.csr -req -days 365 -out GSvarServer.crt

If you use self-signed certificates IGV and libcurl will not work.(See possible fix [below](#trust-self-signed-certificates-on-ubuntu))

Next you have to create a `GSvarServer.ini` in the `bin`folder:

> cp bin/GSvarServer.ini.example bin/GSvarServer.ini

And perform the [configuration](configuration.md). 

If you use encrypted passwords you have to add the crypt key to the `cppCORE` directory (sometimes not working on linux) or directly to the `cppCORE.pro` file. 

Next step is to build the server:

> make build_libs_release build_server_release

And run it:

> ./bin/GSvarServer

Now you can adapt the [configuration](../GSvar/configuration.md) in your client and connect to the server.


### Trust self-signed certificates on Ubuntu
For the development and testing purposes it is possible to run a local instance of GSvar Server. However, if you are using self-signed certificates, you will have to make them trusted (otherwise IGV and libcurl will not be able to verify them):

Install CA certificates package:

> sudo apt-get install ca-certificates

Copy your self-signed certificate to this location:

> sudo cp YOUR_CERTIFICATE.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates

Update the list of certificate authorities:

> sudo update-ca-certificates


## Local development environment

You are going to need a SSL certificate and a key for the server to support HTTPS protocol. For the development purposes self-signed ones will be sufficient:

> openssl req -new -newkey rsa:4096 -days 365 -nodes -x509 -subj "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Tuebingen/O=test-certificate/CN=localhost" -keyout ~/test-key.key -out ~/test-cert.crt

GSvarServer requires a MySQL/MariaDB database. 


## Qt debug statements

Depending on the Qt installation, you may have disabled debug statements by default. To turn them on, follow these steps:
- Open qtlogging.ini in /etc/xdg/QtProject/ (create a new empty file, if it does not exist)
- Add (or modify accordingly) the following config

[Rules]  
*.debug=true  
qt.*.debug=false
