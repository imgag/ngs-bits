# Data analysis

## What are the analysis steps of the different pipelines?

### germline - single sample pipeline

The germline single-sample pipeline is used to analyze a single case.  
It consists of read mapping and several variant calling and annotation steps:

### germline - multi-sample pipeline / trio pipeline

Multi-sample and trio analyses are bases on mapped reads (BAM file), which is usually generated using the single-sample pipeline.  
On the BAM files the joined variant calling is preformed for all samples.  
Here an example of a multi-sample analysis with two samples:

## What is the difference between re-annotation and a normal analysis.

When performing reannotation (e.g. by checking the box `annotate only` in the single-sample analysis dialog) the variant calling step is skipped.  
Existing variant calls are used and annotations are updated.

This is usually done when the annotation data is older than a few months.  
Up-to-data annotation data is important as public databases (ClinVar, HGMD, OMIM, ...) are updated regularly.


## Where can I trigger analysis jobs?

You can trigger the (re-)analysis of the processed samples from several places in GSvar.

###Analysis status tab

The `analysis status` tab is opened from the GSvar tool bar (![alt text](analysis_status.png)):

![alt text](analysis_status_widget.png)

Here you see all analysis jobs and their current status.

In the upper right corner of the tab, you find buttons to queue the analysis of:

- single sample analysis
- trios analysis
- multi-sample analysis
- somatic analysis


### Processed sample tab

In the upper part of the `processed sample` tab, you can (re-)start the single-sample analysis of the processed sample using the button (![alt text](analysis_restart.png)).  

### Main tool bar

In the main tool bar, you can restart the analysis of the currently open GSvar file using the button (![alt text](analysis_restart.png)).  
This works for all analysis types:

- single sample analysis
- trios analysis
- multi-sample analysis
- somatic analysis

### Sample search

The `sample search` can be opened via the main menu bar of GSvar (![alt text](sample_search.png)).  
Here processed samples can be searched for, e.g. of a project, run or processing system.  
Through the context menu of the search results, a batch of samples can be analyzed.

### Where can I see the analysis progress?

The analysis status and progress of individual samples can be shown using the button ![alt text](analysis_info.png).  
It is available from tool bar of the `processed sample tab` and through the context menu of `analysis status` table.
