## CNV analysis for exomes/genomes 


ClinCNV is a copy-number calling algorithm designed for exome and genome sequencing, which is based on the depth of coverage of adjacent regions.  
In exome sequencing, exon target regions alternate with non-target intron regions.  
In genome sequencing, a region is defined as a 1000 bases windows of the genomes.

For each regions, the expected depth of coveraged is compared with the observed depth of coverage and a log-likelihood of a copy-number alteration is gived for each region. 

### CNV analysis quality

Visualization and filtering of CNVs is done in the "Copy-number variants" dialog, which is shown below.
The dialog is opened from the main tool bar (0). 

In the upper part of the dialog (1), sample-specific information about the CNV calling is shown. It gives an impression  of the sample quality:

* *number of high-quality CNVs* - high-quality means above log-likelihood 20 (see below for expected numbers).
* *gender of sample* - gender determined from the depth-of-coverage data during the CNV calling.
* *number of iterations:* If more CNVs than expected are encountered for a sample, the algorithm sensitivity is decreased and the algorithm is re-applied until a reasonable number of CNVs is called. The number of iterations counts how often the algorithm was started. Normally, this should be 1. A higher number idicates a problem during the analysis of the sample.

### CNV filtering

On the right side, default filters can be selected and modified (2).
For each CNV the following properties are shown (3):

* genomic position
* size (kB)
* number of regions (exons/bins)
* affected genes
* copy-number change
* log-likelihood: logarithm of the ratio between likelihoods of the *no CN change model* vs the *CN equal to the reported state model* (bigger is better)
* potential AF: frequency of the copy-number change in the analyzed cohort, i.e. the 100-200 most similar samples *(Note: this can deviate from the population allele frequency, especially for rare CNVs)*
* q-value: p-value corrected for the number of CNVs detected (smaller is better)

Additionally, generic annotation columns are added (4), e.g.:

* overlap af_genomes_imgag: overlap with copy-number-polymorphism regions
	* The first number is the overlap with the CNP regions (AF>2%) determined from 650 in-house genomes. The range is 0 (no overlap) to 1 (complete overlap).
    * The numbers in brackets are the allele-frequency (i.e. the fraction of samples with CN not equal to 2) of sub-regions within the overlap.
	* These numbers are calculated from the the `AF TruSeqPCRfree` track described below.
* cn_pathogenic: in-house database of pathogenic CNVs
* dosage_sensitive_disease_genes: dosage-sensitive disease genes (from [ClinGen Dosage Sensitivity Map](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/dbvar/clingen/))
* clinvar_cnvs: overlapping (likely-)pathogenic CNVs in ClinVar
* hgmd_cnvs: overlapping (likely-)pathogenic CNVs in HGMD
* OMIM genes
* gene_info: gene-specific information from NGSD
	* gnomAD o/e score for LOF variants
	* overlap with gene (complete, intronic/intergenic, exonic/splicing)

More information about a copy-number variant can be found through the resources linked in the context menu.  

**Note:**  
Columns marked with a table symbol can contain a lot of information in each cell.  
To make them readable, they can be displayed as a table by double-clicking the cell.  
In this details table, the first column contains the database identifier of the entry.
If the database identifier is marked with a link symbol, it be double-clicked to open the source database page.



### Number of CNVs to expect

To allow very sensitive CNV detection, we use a very low log-likelihood cutoff of 3 and call down to one exon/region when executing ClinCNV.  
However, by default GSvar only shows CNVs with a more conservative log-likelihood of 20 or higher.  
To increase sensitivity, the user can lower the log-likelihood cutoff.

However, when lowering the cutoff, the number of CNVs increases dramatically.  
Thus, low cutoffs should only be used when looking at specific regions of interest, e.g. a single gene that matches the phenotype of the patient.

The following table shows the expected number of CNVs for exomes/genomes using different log-likelihood cutoffs:

<table>
	<tr><th>log-likelihood cutoff</th><th>exome</th><th>genome</th></tr>
	<tr><td>3</td><td>500-2500</td><td>3000-5000</td></tr>
	<tr><td>10</td><td>150-350</td><td>1400-2100</td></tr>
	<tr><td>20</td><td>50-120</td><td>800-1400</td></tr>
	<tr><td>40</td><td>20-70</td><td>500-800</td></tr>
	<tr><td>100</td><td>&lt;40</td><td>&lt;500</td></tr>
</table>

**Note:** The CNV numbers listed above include CNVs down to one exon/region.  
When increasing the required number of subsequent regions, e.g. to 3, the number of CNVs is reduced significantly!

### Visualizing copy-number data in IGV

*Double-clicking* a CNV in the dialog, opens the CNV region in IGV (see also section [IGV integration](igv_integration.md)).

Usually, three tracks are shown that help you interprete the CNV (see the screenshot below):

* copy number track (1): The copy-number estimates for each region (exon/bin) are shown. Gains are displayed in blue and losses are displayed in red. When hovering over a region, the variance in the reference cohort is also shown.
* BAF track (2): b-allele-frequency of known SNPs in the sample. This track can be used to validate large deletions (no heterozygous variants, thus all BAFs should be 0 or 1) and for large heterozygous duplications (the center line of SNPs with AF 0.5 should split in two lines around 0.33 and 0.66).
* AF TruSeqPCRfree (3): This track shows the copy-number-poymorphism regions (i.e. regions in wich more than 2% of our WGS samples don't have copy-number two). Lighter blue indicates lower AF, darker blue indicates higher AF and gray means that this region is not a CNP region. When hovering over a CNP region, the copy-number distribution in our cohort is shown in brackets as count for copy-number 0, copy-nuber 1, etc. up to count for copy-number 10.

We can adapt the IGV settings of the BAM track to visualize the breakpoints created by a copy-number variant (if they lie inside the target region):

* Open perferences dialog `View > Preferences` and on the `Alignments` tab, enable `Show soft-clipped bases`.
* Right-click on the BAM track and enable `View as pairs`.
* Right-click on the BAM track and enable `Color alignments by > Insert size and pair orientation`. 

Then, it is clear that in this case there is a tandem duplication of the region from exon 1 to exon 3.
