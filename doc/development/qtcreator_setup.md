# QtCreator setup

## General settings
There are a few things we have to set in the QtCreator options just once:

 * `Edit -> Preferences -> Environment -> Interface -> Language: English`
 * `Edit -> Preferences -> C++ -> Code Style -> Custom Settings`: Import `QtCreatorCodingStyle.clang-format` (from ngs-bits/doc/development/)
 * `Edit -> Preferences -> C++ -> File Naming -> Lower case file names: off`
