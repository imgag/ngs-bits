### SvFilterAnnotations tool help
	SvFilterAnnotations (2021_03-58-g9b3abcdd)
	
	Filter a structural variant list in BEDPE format based on variant annotations.
	
	The filter definition file lists one filter per line using the following syntax:
	name[tab]param1=value[tab]param2=value...
	
	The order in the filter definition file defines the order in which the filters are applied.
	
	Several of the filters offer more than one action:
	  FILTER - Remove variants if they do not match the filter.
	  REMOVE - Remove variants if they match the filter.
	  KEEP - Force variants to be kept, even if filtered out by previous filter steps.
	
	The following filters are supported:
	SV OMIM genes            Filter for OMIM genes i.e. the 'OMIM' column is not empty.
	                         Parameters:
	                           action - Action to perform [default=FILTER] [valid=REMOVE,FILTER]
	SV PE read depth         Show only SVs with at least a certain number of Paired End Reads
	                         (In trio/multi sample all (affected) samples must meet the requirements.)
	                         Parameters:
	                           PE Read Depth - minimal number of Paired End Reads [default=0] [min=0]

	SV allele frequency NGSD Filter based on the allele frequency of this structural variant in the NGSD.
	                         Note: this filter should only be used for whole genome samples.

	SV compound-heterozygous Filter for compound-heterozygous SVs.
	                         Mode 'SV-SV' detects genes with two or more SV hits.
