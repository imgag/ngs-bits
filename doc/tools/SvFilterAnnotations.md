### SvFilterAnnotations tool help
	SvFilterAnnotations (2024_02-126-g4f44d5e5)
	
	Filter a structural variant list in BEDPE format based on variant annotations.
	
	The filter definition file lists one filter per line using the following syntax:
	name[tab]param1=value[tab]param2=value...
	
	The order in the filter definition file defines the order in which the filters are applied.
	
	Several of the filters offer more than one action:
	  FILTER - Remove variants if they do not match the filter.
	  REMOVE - Remove variants if they match the filter.
	  KEEP - Force variants to be kept, even if filtered out by previous filter steps.
	
	The following filters are supported:
	SV CNV overlap              Filter the removes DEL/DUP without support from CNV calling.
